Motivation:
For some components it only makes sense to have on in the system
    Database repository
    Object factory
E,g the constructor call is expensive
    We only do it once
    We provide everyone with the same instance
Want to prevent anoyone creating additonal copies
Need to take care of lazy instantiation and thread safety

Singelton - A component which is instantitated only once

Summary:
Making a 'safe' singleton is easy: construct a static Lazy<T> and return its Value.
Singletons are difficult to test.
Instead of directly using a singleton, consider depndening on an abstraction (e.g, an interface)
Consider defining singleton lifetime in DI container
