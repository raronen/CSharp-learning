Motivation:
* Some objects are simple and can be created in single constructor call.
* Other objects require a lot of ceremony to create (e.g html tags).
* Having an object with 10 constructor arguments is not productive!
* Instead, opt for piecewise construction.
* Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step.

A builder is a separate component for building an object
Can either give a builder a constructor or return it via a static function
To make builder fluent, return this
Different facets of an object can be built with different builders working in tandem via a base class
