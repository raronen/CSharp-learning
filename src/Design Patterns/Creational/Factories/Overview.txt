1. Factory Method - Popular
2. Abstracdt Factory - Relativly rare.

Motivation:
* Object creation logic becomes too convoluted.
* Constructor is not descriptive.
  Name mandated by name of containing type.
  Cannot overload the same sets of arguments with different names.
  Can turn into 'optional parameter hell'
* Object creation (non-piecewise, unlike Builder) can be outsourced to
      A seperate function (Factory Method)
      That may exit in a separate class (Factory)
      Can cre3ate hierarchy of factories with Abstract Factory


Factory - A component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects.

Factory can also keep track of every item it creates, and then you can replacethem if you want.


Summary:
A factory method is a static method that creates objects.
A factory can take care of object creation.
A factory can be external or reside inside the object as inner class.
Hierarchies of factories can be used to create related objects.
