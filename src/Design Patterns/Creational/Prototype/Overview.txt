Motivation:
1. Complicated objects (e.g cars, iphone) aren't designed from scratch.
2. An existing (partially or fully cosntructed) design is a Prototype.
3. We make a copy (clone) the prototype and customize it
   Requires 'deep copy' support
   We make the cloning convenient (e.g via a factory)

Prototype - A paritally or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of.
