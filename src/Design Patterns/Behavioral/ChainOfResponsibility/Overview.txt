Chain of responsibility - A chain of components who all get a chance to process a command or a query, optionally,
having a default processing implementation and an ability to terminate the process chain.

Command = asking for an action or change.
Query = asking for information (without chaning something)
CQS = having seperate means of sending commands and queries to:
    e.g: direct field access.
