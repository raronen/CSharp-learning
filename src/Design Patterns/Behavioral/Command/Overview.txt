Motivation:
Ordinary C# statements are perishable - 
    Cannot undo a field/property assignment
    Cannot directly serialize a sequence of actions (calls)
Want an object that represents operation
    e.g X should change its property Y to Z
    X should do W()
Users: GUI Commands, multi level undo/redo, macro recording and more!

Command - An object which represents an instruction to performa a prticular action. 
Contains all the information necessary for the action to be taken
