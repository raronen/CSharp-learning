Some examples
    Programming language compilers, interpeters and IDEs
    HTML, XML and similar

Turning string into OOP based structures in an complicated process

Interpeter - a component that processes structured text data. Does so by turning it into seperate lexical 
tokens (lexing) and then interpreting sequences of said tokens (parsing)
