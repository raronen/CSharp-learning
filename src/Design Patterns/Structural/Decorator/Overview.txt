Motivation:
Want to augment an object with additional functionality
Do not want to rewrite or alter existing code (OCP)
Want to keep new functionality seperate (SPP)
Need to be able to interact with existing structres
Two options:
    inherit from required object if possible; some objects are sealed
    Build a Decorator, which simply references the decorated object(s)


Decorator - Facilitates the additional behaviors to individual objects without inheiring from them.
