Electrial devices are different power (interface) requierements
    Voltage (5V, 220V)
    Socket/plug type (Europe, UK, USA)
We cannot modify our gadgets to support every possible interface
    some support possible (e.g 120/220V)
Thus, we use a special device( an adapter) to give us the interface we require from interface we have

Adapater - A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y.

Summary:
Implementing an Adapter is easy
Determine the API you have and the API you Need
Create a component which aggregates(has a refence to) the adapeter
Inermediate the represenations can pile up: use caching and other optimizations.
