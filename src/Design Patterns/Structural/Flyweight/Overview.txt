Motivation:
Space optimizations! == Memory optimizations!
Avoid redundancy when storing Database
    e.g Plenty of users with identical first/last names
    No sense in storing same first/last name over and over again.
    Store a list of names and pointers to them
.NET performs *string interning*, so an identical string is stored only once
E.g bold or italic text in the console
    Don't want each character to have a formatting character
    Operate on ranges(e.g line number, start/end positions)

    Flyweight - a space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by sotring externally the data ssociated with similar objects.
