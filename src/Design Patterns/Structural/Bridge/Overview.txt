Motivation:
Bridge prevents a 'Cartesian product' complexity explosion
Example:
    Base class ThreadScheduler
    Can be preemtive or cooperative
    Can run on Windows or Uix
    End up with a 2x2 scenario: WidnowsPTS, UnixPTS, WindowsCTS, UnixCTS
Bridge pattern tries to avoid entity explosion.

Bridge - A mechanism that decouples an interface(hierarchy) from an implementation (hierarchy)



Summary:
Decouple abstraction from implementation.
Both can exist as hierarchies.
A stronger form of encapsulation.
